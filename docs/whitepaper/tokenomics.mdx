## üî• Deflationary Mechanism

### Token Burn Strategy

GoChapaa implements a deflationary token model through quarterly token burns:

#### Burn Triggers
- **Transaction Volume**: 2% of quarterly transaction fees
- **Platform Revenue**: 1% of quarterly platform revenue
- **Staking Rewards**: 0.5% of quarterly staking rewards
- **Partnership Fees**: 1% of quarterly partnership revenue

#### Burn Calculation
```
Quarterly Burn = (Transaction Fees √ó 2%) + (Platform Revenue √ó 1%) + (Staking Rewards √ó 0.5%) + (Partnership Fees √ó 1%)
```

#### Maximum Burn Cap
- **Maximum 50%** of total supply can be burned
- **Minimum 290M GOC** will always remain in circulation
- **Burn events** are publicly announced and verifiable on-chain

### Burn Schedule Example

| Year | Quarterly Burn (Est.) | Annual Burn | Remaining Supply |
|------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | 2M GOC | 8M GOC | 572M GOC |
| 2 | 5M GOC | 20M GOC | 552M GOC |
| 3 | 10M GOC | 40M GOC | 512M GOC |
| 4 | 15M GOC | 60M GOC | 452M GOC |
| 5 | 20M GOC | 80M GOC | 372M GOC |
